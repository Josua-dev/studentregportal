STUDENT REGISTRATION PORTAL 

Project Overview  
This project is a Student Registration Portal I have built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
So it basically allows users to:  
- Register students through a form.  
- Display live student profile cards.  
- Maintain a summary table with student details.  
- Add and remove student records dynamically.  

 Project Structure  

 index.html   # Main HTML file with registration form, profiles, and summary table
 script.js    # JavaScript file handling validation, profile creation, and interactivity
 style.css    # Stylesheet for layout and modern design

Features  
Form Validation – Required fields (name, email, programme, year) must be valid before submission.  
Dynamic Profiles – Students are displayed as profile cards with name, programme, and year.  
Summary Table – Shows all registered students in a structured format.  
Remove Functionality – Students can be removed from both the card view and summary table.  
Default Photo Support – Uses a placeholder photo if none is provided.  
Responsive Grid – Profile cards adjust layout automatically for different screen sizes.  
Modern UI Styling – Styled using CSS with shadows, rounded corners, and hover effects.

The style.css file includes:

- A styled form with validation error messages.  
- A professional-looking summary table with alternating background and highlighted headers.
